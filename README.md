# Raspberry Pi Computer Vision
Simple scripts, pre-trained models, and OpenCV tutorials free for all to use!
NOTE: This project began on 8/5/2019. As such, not many of the folders described below are ready. 

# Folder Descriptions
Core Ideas: An introductory series to computer vision using OpenCV. Also covers setting up your computer vision environment (first two tutorials out!).

Mathematical Concepts: Documents describing numerical computation. Anybody who knows me well will say that I'm a hardware junkie, so I will also discuss how numerical computation can be optimized for CPU caches/memory optimizations/heterogenous systems.

Deep Learning With OpenCV: Just like the name suggests. I will group code, models, and image/video testing clips under a single folder for each project.

Guest Articles: Skilled computer vision engineers can write about their experiences. New perspectives are great!

If you know anybody who makes a difference in the world of computer vision, please ask them if they would like to write a guest article! I will publish it under the "Guest Articles" folder for the world to see. 

# Expected Release Schedule
