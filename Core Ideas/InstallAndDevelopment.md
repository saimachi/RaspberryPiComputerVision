Let's get started with OpenCV! First, however, you're probably going to need to install it. Consider using the pip installer to do so. Information about that approach can be found here: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/19/pip-install-opencv/. The article also gives a good description about the major OpenCV packages you can install.

For the more adventurous who want to squeeze every last bit of performance, OpenCV can be built from source. This method involves CMake, and for Linux users, can be viewed here: https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html. macOS users can look here: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/17/install-opencv-4-on-macos/. Use the most updated version of the OpenCV source; as of 8/5/2019, it is https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.1. I am intentionally not including Windows instructions here: I do not recommend it as a computer vision development platform. If you must however, there are a plethora of tutorials on the web. 

As this course focuses on the Raspberry Pi, this tutorial explains building natively on the Pi. Since building it was a slow experience, even on my Pi 4 with 2 GB of RAM, I would recommend that you use a Debian docker container to cross-compile. 

I am not an expert on computer vision myself: I am writing this series to ensure that I fully comprehend the core concepts. As such, if something seems inaccurate, file an issue. Let's keep the information on this page as accurate and modern as possible!

NOTE: You can skip to the next tutorial if you're not using a headless setup. 
Many of you may be developing on a headless environment--one which you cannot interact with a directly connected keyboard and mouse. I am using this approach, as my Raspberry Pi 4 is located in another room. However, this is perfectly fine for computer vision development! With this approach, you will use your local machine (the computer you are presumably using to view this page) to develop code, but execute the developed software on the remote machine (a Raspberry Pi 4 or VPS instance). 

On UNIX and UNIX-like systems, SSH can be used to run commands remotely. An SSH system consists of an SSH server running on the remote machine and an SSH client running on the local machine. If you are not using private keys, SSH requires the IP address and credentials of the remote machine. To use SSH on a Debian or Ubuntu remote machine (including the Raspberry Pi), install openssh-server. Use "ssh <user>@<IP address>" to SSH into a remote machine on a Linux or macOS local machine (granted that Remote Login is enabled on macOS). Windows users should use PuTTY.
